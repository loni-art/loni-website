			<p>
				after doing this simple, working layout, my mind began racing<br>
				"you have to make it for you! you have to make it experimental! great! branded!"<br>
				I just want to enjoy myself with this one for a while, its pretty cozy in its standardness, it'll probably be up for a year or so until i learn to web
				well enough to try my wilder ideas.<br><br>
				the crossplay between standing out and being readable is a hard one to grasp,
				and honestly, I feel like staying on the latter side while learning is the best option right now.<br>
				at least I can enjoy reading this instead of bleeding my eyes out! hahaha<br>
				cya later!
