			<h1>thanks wave</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<a href="https://medium.com/waveac/this-is-goodbye-for-now-d8ee96b0825e">wave.ac announced its closure as a web streaming plataform effective 10 of august</a>, which is a shame, although I wasnt particularily active in its community, their sound quality and just their existence meant trusting it as a backup for my soundcloud, if anything happened to my account, the songs would still be wave.ac<br>
<br>
The wavefest was a great time, and it lead me to meeting some pretty cool people! <br>
The team did their job well, i understand their reasons, and i hope the best for them in the future<br>
<br>
oh also, posting this to my blog also means that the link on my main page will be removed with my account
